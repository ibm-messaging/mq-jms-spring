# A very simple script to extract the QMgr's certificate from its kdb file
# and then add it back into a local JKS file (assuming it exists). This
# could be made a lot more bulletproof and get parameterised. But it's enough
# for my environment.

# Password used for both the qmgr's keystore, and the new truststore that this
# program refers to
pw="passw0rd"

set -x # So you can see what it's doing
# Default label for the qmgr certificate. Keystore given in qmgr attributes.
rm -f qm1.arm
runmqckm -cert -extract -db /var/mqm/ssl/key.kdb -pw $pw -label ibmwebspheremqqm1 -target qm1.arm

# Now import that cert into a new keystore/truststore
rm -f key.jks
runmqckm -keydb -create -db key.jks -pw $pw -type jks
runmqckm -cert  -add    -db key.jks -pw $pw -file qm1.arm -label ibmwebspheremqqm1
