# IBM MQ JMS Spring Components

This repository contains code to help to provide Spring developers with easy configuration of the IBM MQ JMS package.

The library contains:

-   `mq-jms-spring-boot-starter` for [Spring Boot 2](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) applications

## Installation and Usage

The compiled version of this package can be automatically downloaded from Maven Central. For local modifications
and building it yourself, see [BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md)

### Spring Boot Applications

Gradle:

    repositories {
       mavenLocal()
       mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        compile group: 'com.ibm.mq', name: 'mq-jms-spring-boot-starter', version: '2.2.6'
    }

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ibm.mq</groupId>
  <artifactId>mq-jms-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
  <version>2.2.6</version>
</dependency>
```

**Note** This repository and the corresponding Maven Central artifact require
Spring Boot 2. For Spring Boot 1 compatibility, you can use the previously-released
level of the artifact at version 0.0.4.

## Design Approach

The approach taken here is to follow the model for JMS applications shown in the
[Spring Getting Started Guide for JMS](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-jms/). That in turn
is based on using the [JmsTemplate Framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.5.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#jms-jmstemplate)

A simple example program using Spring Boot and JMS interfaces can be found in the samples directory. The RUNME.sh program
compiles and executes it. The application.properties file in that tree may need modification for your environment.

Essentially what gets configured from this package are a ConnectionFactory which Spring's JmsTemplate implementation
exploits to provide a simpler interface, and a MessageListener.

## Getting Started

To get started quickly, you can use the default configuration settings in this package along with the
IBM MQ for Developers container which runs the server processes.

### Default Configuration

The default options have been selected to match the
[MQ Docker container](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-container) development configuration.

This means that you can run a queue manager using that Docker environment and connect to it. This script
will run the container on a Linux system.

    docker run --env LICENSE=accept --env MQ_QMGR_NAME=QM1 \
               --publish 1414:1414 \
               --publish 9443:9443 \
               --detach \
               ibmcom/mq

The default attributes are

    ibm.mq.queueManager=QM1
    ibm.mq.channel=DEV.ADMIN.SVRCONN
    ibm.mq.connName=localhost(1414)
    ibm.mq.user=admin
    ibm.mq.password=passw0rd

### Connection security

The default userid and password have been chosen for a commonly-used queue manager
configuration.

To disable user/password checking entirely, you must set the `ibm.mq.user` attribute to an empty value
so that the default is not used.

```
   ibm.mq.user=
```

Of course, that level of access must be permitted by your queue manager. The usual CHLAUTH and CONNAUTH
rules will apply to assign an identity to the connection.

Configuration of secure connections with TLS are discussed below.

### Configuration Options

If you already have a running MQ queue manager that you want to use, then you can easily modify the
default configuration to match by providing override values.

The queue manager name is given as

-   `ibm.mq.queueManager`

For client connections to a queue manager, you must also set either

-   `ibm.mq.channel`
-   `ibm.mq.connName`
    or
-   `ibm.mq.ccdtUrl`

If both the channel and connName are not supplied, and the CCDTURL is not supplied,
then a local queue manager is assumed. The CCDTURL property is taken in preference to
the channel and connName.

Optionally you can provide a [client id](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.dev.doc/q112000_.html)
and [application name](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.1.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.dev.doc/q111810_.htm) if required.

-   `ibm.mq.clientId`
-   `ibm.mq.applicationName`

You will probably also need to set

-   `ibm.mq.user`
-   `ibm.mq.password`

to override the default values.

For example in an `application.properties` file:

    ibm.mq.queueManager=QM1
    ibm.mq.channel=SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN
    ibm.mq.connName=server.example.com(1414)
    ibm.mq.user=user1
    ibm.mq.password=passw0rd

Spring Boot will then create a ConnectionFactory that can then be used to interact with your queue manager.

| ibm.mq.pool.useAnonymousProducers      | Whether to use only one anonymous "MessageProducer" instance. Set it to false to create one "MessageProducer" every time one is required |

#### Caching connection factory options

Alternatively you may use the default Spring Caching connection factory with the default Spring JMS properties

| Option                              | Description                                      |

| spring.jms.cache.producers          | Whether to cache message producers               |
| spring.jms.cache.session-cache-size | Size of the session cache (per JMS Session type) |

### JMS Polling Listener Timer configuration

The Spring AbstractPollingMessageListenerContainer interface has a default polling timer of 1 second. This can now be configured
with the `spring.jms.listener.receiveTimeout` property. If the property is not explicitly set, then this MQ Spring Boot
component resets the initial timeout value to 30 seconds which has been shown to be more cost-effective. Application code
can still set its own preferred value.

| Option                              | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| spring.jms.listener.receiveTimeout  | How frequently to poll for received messages. Default is 1s. Given as a Duration string: "1m", "60s", "60000" are equivalent  |
